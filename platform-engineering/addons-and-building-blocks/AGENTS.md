# addons-and-building-blocks

## Purpose
Skill that guides authoring + reviewing **layered Kubernetes platform blueprints**: baseline cluster addons (ArgoCD App-of-Apps with `base_chart/` + `addon_charts/*`), shared Helm library charts (`myorg.*` / `plat-net.*` helpers), and application-level building blocks (databases on CloudNativePG, caches via Crossplane `RedisCache`, …). Covers OCI chart distribution (`oci://ghcr.io/<org>/helm-charts`), ArgoCD `Application` templates with sync waves + `ServerSideApply` + `ignoreDifferences`, the wrapper-chart `tests/chart/` helm-unittest pattern, the four-tier validation gate (`yamllint` → `helm lint` → `helm-unittest` → `kubeconform`), and the Terraform + Terratest AKS foundation that bootstraps ArgoCD.

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Edit `SKILL.md` only.
- The "layer cake" mental model (AKS foundation → baseline addons → commons library → building blocks → product charts) is the central abstraction — every other rule depends on the one-way downward dependency flow. Do not edit it without intent.
- The skill encodes nine non-negotiable rules at the top (layer cake, one library per prefix, OCI-only deps in production, `| trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-"`, quote every Crossplane string, camelCase Helm values + snake_case ArgoCD values, wrapper-chart testing, `make all` parity with CI + Helm pinned to v3.20.0, never push to `master`). Treat them as load-bearing — flag PR violations against them before anything else.
- The `description:` field is unusually long because this skill must trigger on many file patterns and PR-level signals. When extending coverage, extend the description's trigger list to match.

### Testing Requirements
- **`scripts/validate-skills.sh` validates this directory** (its `DOMAIN_DIRS` includes `platform-engineering/`) — CI runs it on every push and PR. Run it locally before pushing; it checks:
  1. YAML frontmatter parses and contains `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, non-empty `metadata` map.
  2. Body after closing `---` is non-empty.
  3. Fenced code-block markers are even in count.

### Common Patterns
- "Non-negotiables encoded in this skill" numbered list — same authoring style as the `github-actions` skill.
- "WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL" matrix opens both platform-engineering skills.
- Long, exhaustive `description:` trigger lists are the convention here (vs the more focused descriptions in `coding/`).

## Dependencies

### Internal
- `../../README.md` — references this skill in the "Platform Engineering" table.
- `../../scripts/validate-skills.sh` — validates this file (its `DOMAIN_DIRS` includes `platform-engineering/`); CI runs it on every push and PR.
- `../crossplane/SKILL.md` — sibling skill about **building** a Crossplane control plane (XRDs, Compositions, functions, packages). This skill only **consumes** provider-shipped Managed Resources inside Helm building blocks; defer Crossplane authoring guidance there.

### External
None at runtime — this is documentation, not code.
